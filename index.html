    Insert the information in the form and the calculator will determine the asset coverage ratio<br> 
    What is the asset coverage ratio?<br>
    The asset coverage ratio is a measurement of the company's efficiency in repaying it's debts by liquidating or selling it's assets. high coverage ratio means that the company can cover it's debt most of the times.<br>
    How to calculate asset coverage ratio?<br>
    To calculate asset coverage ratio you should use the following formula:<br>
    asset coverage ratio = ((assets - intangible assets) - (current liabilities - short term debt)) / total debt<br>
    example: Company x has $345,000,000 worth of assets, $40,000,000 of intangible assets, $90,000,000 in liabilities, $50,000,000 of short term debt and $60,000,000 worth of long term debt, calculate the asset coverage ratio?<br>
    Using the asset coverage ratio formula the answer will be:<br>
    asset coverage ratio = ((assets - intangible assets) - (current liabilities - short term debt)) / total debt<br>
    asset coverage ratio = (($345,000,000 - $40,000,000) - ($90,000,000 - $50,000,000)) / ($60,000,000 + $50,000,000)<br>
    asset coverage ratio = 2.4<br>
    Why use asset coverage ratio?<br>
    Investors and analysts use the coverage ratio in order to determine the financial sovency of a company because it measures how well the company can pay it's debt by liquidating or selling it's assets.<br>
